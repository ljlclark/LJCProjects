      <para>
        The backup process runs in two parts. This is done to allow the user to
        review the proposed changes if desired before updating the target files.
      </para>
      <para>
        1. Run the LJCCreateFileChanges.exe program to create the "Changes"
        file.&lt;br /&gt;
        2. Run the LJCBackupChanges.exe program to perform the "Copy" and
        "Delete" messages in the "Change" file.
      </para>
      <para>
        The LJCBackupChanges.exe program's main functionality is provided in
        the file LJCBackupChangesLib.dll, class BackupChanges.
      </para>
      <para>
        The LJCBackupChanges.exe program copies files to, or deletes files from,
        the target root folder and subfolders using a filespec based on the
        targetRoot, each source "Changes" filespec and the startFolder
        value.&lt;br /&gt;
      </para>
      <para>
        The program takes two required parameters.
      </para>
      <para>
        targetRoot - The full path to the target files root folder. The files in
        this folder and all subfolders are the target of the backup.&lt;br /&gt;
        The targetRoot is considered to not have a drive identifier if the
        targetRoot does not have a colon ":" in character position 2. In this
        case the program will prompt the user for a drive
        identifier.&lt;br /&gt;
        This is to support multiple external backup drives which may have
        different drive identifier assignments.
      </para>
      <para>
        startFolder - The targetFilespec is created by using the targetRoot
        combined with the remainder of the sourceSpec starting after the
        startFolder.
