  <h3 style="color:blue">The Template Processing</h3>

  <h3>Section Processing</h3>
  <p>
    The lines of the Template are evaluated in order from top to bottom.
  </p>
  <p>
    If no Section Item is in scope, the lines are output just as they
    appear in the template without attempting to process replacement names
    or values.
  </p>
  <p>
    When a #SectionBegin directive is detected, the Section data from the
    Data XML file with the same name as the #SectionBegin directive is
    added to the Active Items list. These Section names are case sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    The code between the #SectionBegin and #SectionEnd directives is
    generated once for each Section Item. The Items for the current Section
    are processed in the same order as they appear in the Data XML file.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Section data is not found, there are no section items to come
    into scope and the Section is of course not processed.
  </p>
  <p>
    As each Item is processed, the replacement names are replaced with the
    available replacement values for the current Item from the Data XML
    file. Replacement Names are case sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    If a replacement name is not found in the current Section Item, then
    the program looks back through the Parent Sections Active Items to see
    if there is a replacement of the same name in scope. It uses that
    replacement value if it is found, otherwise no replacement is performed.
  </p>
  <p>
    When the #SectionEnd directive is detected and there are more Items in
    the current Section, the next available Item comes into scope and the
    template is processed again from the line after the current
    #SectionBegin directive.
  </p>
  <p>
    If there are no more Items to process in the current Section, then the
    current section XML data is removed from the Active Item list and
    processing continues with the next line after the #SectionEnd directive.
  </p>

  <h3>If Processing</h3>
  <p>
    The syntax for the #IfBegin directive is: #IfBegin _ReplacementName_
    Value. The directive "#IfBegin _DataType_ String" is true if the
    Replacement Name exists for the current Item and its content is
    "String".
  </p>
  <p>
    Besides a specific value, the Value can also be "True", "False" or
    "NotNull". It is not case sensitive.
