  <h3 style="color:blue">The Template Syntax</h3>
  <p>
    An LJCGenText "Template" is a text file with Template Directives and
    Replacement Names.
  </p>

  <h3>Directives</h3>
  <p>
    A Template Directive is contained within a single line comment. This
    allows the text file to be edited with the appropriate code editor
    regardless of the language type. The single line comment start
    characters can be specified by the user.
  </p>
  <p>
    A directive starts with the "#" character and has up to three
    properties. These properties are: The directive ID, Name and optional
    Value. The directive ID is not case sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    These are example Directives:<br />
    // #SectionBegin MySectionName<br />
    // #sectionend MySectionName
  </p>
  <p>
    The available Directives are:<br />
  </p>
  <pre class="code">
#SectionBegin - The beginning of a section.
#SectionEnd   - The end of a section.
#IfBegin      - The beginning of an If block.
#IfElse       - The beginning of an Else block.
#IfEnd        - The end of an If block.
#Value        - A replacement name for the parent section.</pre>
  <p>
    The "#Value" directive is used by the GenTextEdit program. It has
    no effect on the GenText program or generated code.
  </p>

  <h3>Replacement Names</h3>
  <p>
    Replacement names are placeholders for the values from the GenText Data
    xml file. Replacement names are case sensitive.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Replacement name starts and ends with an underscore. No spaces are
    allowed in a replacement name or between the name and the enclosing
    underscore values. This is a replacement name: "_ClassName_".
