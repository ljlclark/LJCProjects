  <h3 style="color:blue">View Editor</h3>
  <p>
    The View Editor contains two Dropdown lists. These are the Data Config and
    Table Dropdown lists.

    The View Editor also contains several item lists and tabs. Each tab
    contains an associated list and in some cases other tabs. The lists contain
    View related items that can be created, updated or deleted by the user.
    The View items are associated with the selected Data Source and Table.
  </p>
  <p>
    A View is a definition for the data that will appear in a list. It may
    sometimes be referred to as a Data View. A View is used to create a data
    Request to retrieve the data for the list. It also defines the list columns
    and column order.
  </p>

  <h3>The Item Lists</h3>
  <p>
    The Item Lists are split into three panels. The top panel is the View List.
    This displays the defined views for the selected Data Source and Table<br />
    The middle panel contains the related tabs and their associated lists.
    These lists contain the items related to the selected View.<br />
    The bottom panel is used to display the View Request results.
  </p>

  <h3>Context Menus</h3>
  <p>
    Each list has a Context Menu that can be displayed by clicking the right
    mouse button on the desired list item. The list item is selected and the
    menu items apply to the selected item or list.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are using a Tablet or a laptop in Tablet Mode, touch the desired
    list item and leave your finger on the item for a short while until a box
    is displayed. This shows that the touch is considered a right mouse
    click. Remove your finger and the context menu will be displayed.
