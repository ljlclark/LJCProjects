    Data Item Declaration
  </p>
  <p>
    A Data Item is a named item for storing the data values and other
    information. In programming terms these are like variables.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Data Item line contains at least one name and the vertical bar "|"
    character like the following line.
  </p>
  <p>
    DataItemName|
  </p>
  <p>
    The Data Item Declaration is identified by the vertical bar "|" at the end of
    a single Data Item name or between the name and alternate name.
  </p>
  <p>
    Once declared, a Data Item can appear in any of the other statement types.
  </p>
  <p>
    A Data Item can have an alternate name. It can be used with either name.
    This is allowed for readability and is often used with the plural name.
    Enter the alternate name after the vertical bar.
