		There is a set of members that manager how related lists interact with each
		other	and how the available list actions are displayed to the user.<br />
		The methods are StartWorklist(), ListChange(), DoListChange()
		, ActivateListItem() and SetControlState().<br />
		The property is AllowSelectionChange.<br />

	<div class='Text'>
		Some forms contain more than one list of items that are related. In this
		case, when a parent list item is selected, either with the left mouse button
		or the Up/Down arrow keys, the SelectionChanged event is used to refresh the
		child list with the associated items.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div class='Text'>
		However, when the user selects a context menu with the right mouse button, the
		item under the cursor is not automatically selected. So the program selects
		the item under the cursor. This raises the SelectionChanged event. This
		causes a problem as the SelectionChanged event attempts to retrieve the
		parent identifier from the parent list item, but the parent list item does
		not change until after the SelectionChanged event has processed. Therefore
		the incorrect parent identifier is retrieved.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div class='Text'>
		To overcome this problem, the list updates are performed in the ListChange()
		method. This method is executed after a delay timer that allows the parent
		list item to change to the selected item. The DoListChange() method is called
		to start the timer. When the timer event is raised, it calls the ListChange()
		method. The ListChange() method can be called directly if the delay timer is
		not needed.
	</div>
	<br />
	<div class='Text'>
		The parent control where the item was selected is identified with the ListType
		enumeration. The ListType identifier is passed to the DoListChange() and
		ListChange() methods.
