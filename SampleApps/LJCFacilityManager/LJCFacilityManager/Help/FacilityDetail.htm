  <b>Code</b>
  <p>
    This is the user-defined code for this facility. A code is an abbreviation that
    is easier to use than the long item description.<br />
    So if you define a facility code type for School facilities with the code FACSCH
    and you have a main school and two branches, you might give the schools
    the codes: SCHMAIN, SCHBR1 and SCHBR2. For these schools you would select
    the Facility Type of FACSCH.
  </p>
