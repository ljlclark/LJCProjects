  <h3 style="color:blue">Code Type Detail Dialog</h3>
  <p>
    The Code Type Detail dialog allows the user to create and edit code type
    entries.
  </p>
  <h4>Form Controls</h4>
  <b>Code</b>
  <p>
    This is the code value. A code is a user defined abbreviation that is
    easier to use than the long item description.
  </p>
  <p>
    One possible format for creating a code type value is to use the type
    class abbreviation followed by an abbreviation that makes it unique.
  </p>
  <p>
    So if we are creating Person code types they might follow this pattern.<br />
    PERPAR - A person who is a parent.<br />
    PERSTU - A person who is a student.<br />
    PERCUST - A person who is a customer.<br />
  </p>
  <b>Description</b>
  <p>
    This is the code type description.
  </p>
  <b>Code Type Class</b>
  <p>
    This is the selected code type class.<br />
    A code type class controls the code types can be selected for specific items.<br />
    E.G. A person can only be assigned a code type that belongs to the person type class.
  </p>
  <p>
    A code type can be defined as belonging to one of 8 code type classes. A
    suggested abbreviation is included for each type class.<br />
    Facility Type Class - FAC<br />
    Unit Type Class - UNIT<br />
    Fixture Type Class - FIX<br />
    Equipment Type Class - EQ<br />
    Person Type Class - PER<br />
    Business Type Class - BUS<br />
    Address Type Class - ADDR<br />
    Relation Type Class - REL<br />
  </p>
  <b>OK Button</b>
  <p>
    Saves the entered data and exits the dialog.
  </p>
  <b>Cancel Button</b>
  <p>
    Exits the dialog without saving the entered data.
