  <b>Code</b>
  <p>
    This is the user-defined code for this fixture. A code is an abbreviation that
    is easier to use than the long item description.<br />
    So if you define a fixture code for Air Conditioners with the code FIXAC and you
    have two Air Conditioner units, you might give them the codes: AC1 and
    AC2. For these fixtures you would select the Fixture Type of FIXAC.
