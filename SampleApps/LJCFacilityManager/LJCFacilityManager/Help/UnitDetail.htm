  <h4>Form Controls</h4>
  <b>Code</b>

    This is the user-defined code for this unit. A code is an abbreviation that
    is easier to use than the long item description.<br />
    So if you define a unit code type for Classrooms with the code UNITCLS and you
    have three Classrooms, you might give the classrooms the codes: CSLA, CLSB
    and CLSC. For these units you would select the Unit Type of UNITCLS.
