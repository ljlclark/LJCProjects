In this context the term "Grid" refers to an LJCDataGrid control.

List Windows typically use the associated Data Object class name to make Grid
methods and other Grid related values unique. The text "_ClassName_" is used to
represent the Data Object class name.

List Window with standard LJCDataGrids:
  
  The InitializeControls() method calls the SetupGrids() method to setup the
  individual grids.

  The individual grid setup methods are called SetupGrid_ClassName_.

  If the Grid does not already have defined columns:

    The hard coded default grid columns are definded and saved in a member
	variable.

	The Grid is configured with the default grid columns.

	On "Startup", the RestoreControlValues() and DataRetrieve() methods are called.

	The RestoreControlValues() method restores the window defaults and the Grid
	column widths for all the Grid controls.


List Window with View Enabled LJCDataGrids:

  A ViewHelper instance contains methods to access all of the View data.

  A supporting class named **(View_ClassName_) contains methods for accessing View
  data for the Grid.

  On **("Startup"), the RestoreControlValues() method is called which restores the
  window defaults and the Grid column widths for all the Grids except for View
  Enabled Grids.
  
  The View Dropdown List loads ViewData entries for the target
  ViewTable.

  The **(SetupGrid_ClassName_()) method is called when the View Dropdown List selection
  is changed.

    The ViewHelper.GetGridColumns() method is called with the selected View ID
	value to retrieve the grid columns.

    If no grid columns are returned, then the View_ClassName_
	SaveDefaultGridColumns() method is called. Is saves a default set of display
	columns for a default view.

	The View_ClassName_.ResultGridData property contains the ResultGridData object
	which has methods for using data from a Data Source who's layout is not known
	in advance.

	The ResultGridData.SetGridColumns() method is called with the grid columns.

    The Grid.LJCAddColumns() method is called to add the grid columns.

	The Grid.LJCRestoreColumnValues() method is called to restore the column widths.

  The **(Grid.DataRetrieve_ClassName_View()) method is called.

    The ViewHelper.GetViewData() method is called with the View_ClassName_ TableName
	and ViewDataID properties.

	If no View data is returned, the View_ClassName_.CreateStandardView() method is
	called to create a standard view.
	  The View Dropdown List LJCLoad() method is called to load and select the new
	  standard view.
