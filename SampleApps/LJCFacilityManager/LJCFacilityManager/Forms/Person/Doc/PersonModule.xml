      The Tab Composite User Controls
    </summary>
    <remarks>
      <para>
        The Person Module Tab contains the PersonGrid control. This grid is
        populated based on a Data View.
      </para>
      <para>
        A Data View is a user query that defines the retrieved data. It defines
        the retrieved columns, joins, filters and row order. A
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;DbRequest&lt;/span&gt;
        object is created from the View definition. The
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;DbRequest&lt;/span&gt;
        object is then used to retrieve the data. The
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;ViewHelper&lt;/span&gt;
        object is used to access the View definition.
      </para>
      <para>
        A Data View also defines the displayed grid columns and column order.
      </para>
      <para>
        A custom View object is created that manages the Views for a specific
        table. It is normally named "ViewTableName" where TableName is the name
        of the base table for the view. So in this case the View object is
        named
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;ViewPerson&lt;/span&gt;.
      </para>
      <para>
        If a View for a table is not available, then a default view is created
        and selected. The
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;ViewPerson&lt;/span&gt;
        object has a
        &lt;span class="commonType"&gt;CreateStandardView()&lt;/span&gt;
        method to create a default view.
      </para>
      <para>
        A static grid setup method is called in the
        &lt;span class="commonType"&gt;InitializeControls()&lt;/span&gt;
        method. In this case the grid is dynamically configured based on the
        View. So the private
        &lt;span class="commonType"&gt;SetupGridPerson()&lt;/span&gt;
        method is called when the View is selected.
      </para>
      <para>
        If the View does not have grid columns defined, then the
        &lt;span class="userType"&gt;ViewPerson&lt;/span&gt;
        object
        &lt;span class="commonType"&gt;SaveDefaultGridColumns()&lt;/span&gt;
        method is called to create the default grid columns.
      </para>
      <para>
        The grid column values are not restored until after the grid has been
        configured from the View.
      </para>
      <para>
        The
        &lt;span class="commonType"&gt;DataRetrievePersonView()&lt;/span&gt;
        method is called to populate the control.
      </para>
