  <h3 style="color:blue">Facility Detail Dialog</h3>
  <p>
    The Facility Detail dialog allows the user to create and edit facility
    entries.
  </p>

  <h3>Form Controls</h3>
  <b>Code</b>
  <p>
    This is the user-defined code for this facility. A code is an abbreviation that
    is easier to use than the long item description.<br />
    So if you define a facility code type for School facilities with the code FACSCH
    and you have a main school and two branches, you might give the schools
    the codes: SCHMAIN, SCHBR1 and SCHBR2. For these schools you would select
    the Facility Type of FACSCH.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you have branches in multiple cities, you might include the city abbreviation
    in the codes. E.G. SCHCTYMAIN, SCHCTYBR1 and SCHCTYBR2.
  </p>
  <b>Description</b>
  <p>
    This is the facility description.
  </p>
  <b>Facility Type</b>
  <p>
    This is the facility type selection.<br />
    Only code types that belong to the Facility code type class will appear in
    this list.
  </p>
  <b>OK Button</b>
  <p>
    Saves the entered data and exits the dialog.
  </p>
  <b>Cancel Button</b>
  <p>
    Exits the dialog without saving the entered data.
  </p>

  <h3>Context Menu</h3>
  <p>
    The Context Menu can be displayed by clicking the right mouse button on a
    empty place on the form.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are using a Tablet or a laptop in Tablet Mode, touch the desired
    list item and leave your finger on the item for a short while until a box
    is displayed. This shows that the touch is considered a right mouse
    click. Remove your finger and the context menu will be displayed.
  </p>
  <b>Help</b>
  <p>
    The 'Help' menu item displays the help page for the current dialog.
