  <h3 style="color:blue">Visit Filter Detail Dialog</h3>
  <p>
    The Visit Filter Detail dialog allows the user to enter values that are used
    to filter the Contact Visit List.
  </p>
  <p>
    To 'Filter' a list means to limit the list to items that match user
    selected values.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Filter values are applied with "AND" logic. This means that the items
    that appear in the list must match each value "and" the other entered
    values. So, if you put in a "Last Name" and a "First Name" the list will
    include only those items that match both the "Last Name" and "First Name".
  </p>
  <p>
    The text filters match those items that begin with the entered filter
    letters. The matching is not case sensitive. So, if the "Last Name" filter
    value is "C", then it will match with any entry where the Last Name starts
    with a "C" or "c".
  </p>

  <h3>Form Controls</h3>
  <b>Begin Date</b>
  <p>
    The Begin Date filter value will limit the Contact Visit List to those
    visits that were registered on the Begin Date.

    for selecting the Begin Date.
  </p>
  <b>End Date</b>
  <p>
    The End Date filter value will limit the Contact Visit List to those

    Begin Date and End Date are included with all the register dates between.

  <p>
    The Context Menu can be displayed by clicking the right mouse button on a
    empty place on the form.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are using a Tablet or a laptop in Tablet Mode, touch the desired
    list item and leave your finger on the item for a short while until a box
    is displayed. This shows that the touch is considered a right mouse
    click. Remove your finger and the context menu will be displayed.
