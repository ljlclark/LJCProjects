    The list filters determine which records will appear in the list.
  </p>
  <b>Date Filter</b>
  <p>
    When the Visit List form is first displayed, the Date Filter contains
    today's date and the Visit List is filled with the visits using the Date
    Filter as the Register Date.
  </p>
  <p>
    If the Date Filter is manually changed or changed from the Calendar Dialog,
    then the "Show" button must be selected before the list is refreshed
    using the Date Filter value.
  </p>
  <b>Calendar Button</b>
  <p>
    The Calendar Button displays the
    <a href="CalendarDialog.html">Calendar Dialog</a>. The Calendar Dialog is

  </p>
  <b>Show Button</b>
  <p>
    The Show Button applies the Date Filter and other filters selected from the
    Visit Filter Detail Dialog.
