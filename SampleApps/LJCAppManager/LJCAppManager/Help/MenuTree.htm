  <p>
    The Main window left window pane is a tree view that displays the authorized
    programs and the associated program modules.<br />
    The authorized programs and modules are configured individually for each
    authorized user.

  <p>
    External programs and modules can be added to the App Manager program without
    having to modify the App Manager code. New or existing programs and modules
    can be added as long as they conform to the App Manager Plugin architecture
    requirements.
