      <p>
        The lines of the Template are evaluated in order from top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no Section Item is in scope, the lines are output just as they
        appear in the template without attempting to process replacement names
        or values.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a #SectionBegin directive is detected, the Section data from the
        Data XML file with the same name as the #SectionBegin directive is
        added to the Active Items list. These Section names are case sensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code between the #SectionBegin and #SectionEnd directives is
        generated once for each Section Item. The Items for the current Section
        are processed in the same order as they appear in the Data XML file.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the Section data is not found, there are no section items to come
        into scope and the Section is of course not processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As each Item is processed, the replacement names are replaced with the
        available replacement values for the current Item from the Data XML
        file.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a replacement name is not found in the current Section Item, then
        the program looks back through the Parent Sections Active Items to see
        if there is a replacement of the same name in scope. It uses that
        replacement value if it is found, otherwise no replacement is performed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the #SectionEnd directive is detected and there are more Items in
        the current Section, the next available Item comes into scope and the
        template is processed again from the line after the current
        #SectionBegin directive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If there are no more Items to process in the current Section, then the
        current section XML data is removed from the Active Item list and
        processing continues with the next line after the #SectionEnd directive.
