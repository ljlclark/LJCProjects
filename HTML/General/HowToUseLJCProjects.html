      <h4>Getting the Project Code</h4>
      <p>
        LJCProjects is a GitHub repository of C# Libraries, Utilities and
        Applications. It is available on the web in GitHub at
        <a href="https://github.com/ljlclark/LJCProjects">LJCProjects</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the LJCProjects repository page in GitHub, click on the dropdown icon
        of the green "Code" button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then select the "Download Zip" menu item. You may have to scroll down
        to get to the menu item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next select the "Save As" button. This will save the download  to your
        "Downloads" folder as "LJCProjects-main.zip" or whatever name you choose.
      </p>
      <p>
        You do not have to unzip the entire downloaded file. Instead, you can
        copy only the projects you wish to use. Just double-click your left
        mouse button on the zip file and a virtual ZIP folder will be displayed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create the folder path where you want copy your local code and copy
        what you want from the virtual ZIP folder. You will find it easier if
        you use the root path
        "c:\Users\YourUserName\Documents\Visual Studio 2022\LJCProjects".
      </p>
      <p>
        You should use the same subfolders as in the virtual directory for the
        command files to work correctly. If your subfolders from LJCProjects on
        down are different, you will have to modify the command files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy at a minimum the following files from the virtual ZIP root folder
        to your root folder: 1BuildAll.cmd, 2BuildAssemblies.cmd,
        3BuildUtilities.cmd, 4BuildTestApps.cmd, 5BuildSampleApps.cmd,
        ClearBuild.cmd, ClearBuildDetail.cmd, LICENSE, README.md,
        SubFolders.cmd, TargetFolders.cmd and UpdateAll.cmd.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended to start by copying the following project folders and
        subfolders from CoreAssemblies.
        <pre style="font-size: 9pt">
  LJCNetCommon          .NET Common Library
  LJCDataAccessConfig   Data Access Configuration Library
  LJCDataAccess         ADO.NET Data Access Library</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also copy these helpful test programs from CoreTestApps.
        <pre style="font-size: 9pt">
  LJCNetCommonTest      .NET Common Test Code
  LJCDataAccessTest     ADO.NET Data Access Test Code</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy the following projects and the "Libraries" folders and subfolders
        from CoreAssemblies if you are going to develop with WinForms.<br />
        These projects build the following assemblies:
        <pre style="font-size: 9pt">
  LJCWinFormCommon      WinForm Common Library
  LJCWinFormControls    WinForm Control Library
  LJCDBMessage          Data Message Library
  LJCGridDataLib        Grid Helper Library</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy the following projects for advanced message-based data access.
        <pre style="font-size: 9pt">
  LJCDBDataAccess       Message-based Data Access Library
  LJCTextDataReader     Text DataReader Library
  LJCDBClientLib        Message-based Data Access Client Library
  LJCGridDataTests      GridData Library Test Code (From CoreTestApps)</pre>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now just double-click your left mouse button on BuildAll.cmd in your
        root folder and any project you have copied over will build.
      </p>
