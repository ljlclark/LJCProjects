What is a Text Generator
                                                                            |
There are times when a well designed and standardized text file can be
reused by customizing certain values in the file. It could be a simple legal
document, marketing mailer, routine negative for a radiology department or a
software developer's code.
                                                                            |
In some cases we could use a simple preprinted form with blanks that are
filled out manually when  needed. However, sometimes the document needs to
look like it was done especially for the occasion or it needs to be in a text
file format. In these cases a common approach is to create a template with
the fixed text and placeholders that indicate where the custom data should be
inserted. Then we want to replace those placeholders with the custom data
and generate the customized text file.
                                                                            |
There are many tools available to do this on the computer. Some require the
purchase or download of special software. Many have steep learning curves
and some even require learning complex programming languages to generate the
final text. Sometimes these can be useful; but, often they are overkill and
what we really need is something much simpler.
