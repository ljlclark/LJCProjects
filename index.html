    <p>
      The LJC Libraries, Utilities and Applications are a set of .NET Assemblies
      that were developed to work together with the following objectives:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Shorten the development time for building .NET Business Database Applications.</li>
      <li>
        Provide consistant, reusable code designed to emphasize readability and
        simplified maintenance.
      </li>
      <li>Provide a powerful and flexible set of database libraries.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      The Database Libraries were designed to support the following features:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide consistant, reusable code that simplifies database access and
        encapsulates database access best practices.
      </li>
      <li>
        Switch between the SQL Client, ODBC, OLEDB and MySQL data providers with only
        configuration file changes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Scale between Client/Server, Local Message Based, Remote Data Service
        or Web Data Service data access with only configuration changes.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Most LJC Solutions, Projects and output files are prefixed with "LJC" to distinguish
      them from other potentially similar named items and help prevent naming conflicts.
