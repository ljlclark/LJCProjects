# LJCProjects
The LJC Libraries, Utilities and Applications are a set of .NET Assemblies that were developed to work together with the following objectives:
  * Shorten the development time for building .NET Business Database Applications.
  * Provide consistant, reusable code designed to emphasize readability and simplified maintenance.
  * Provide a powerful and flexible set of database libraries.

The Database Libraries were designed to support the following features:
  * Provide consistant, reusable code that simplifies database access and encapsulates database access best practices.
  * Switch between the SQL Client, ODBC, OLEDB and MySQL data providers with only configuration file changes.
  * Scale between Client/Server, Local Message Based, Remote Data Service or Web Data Service data access with only configuration changes.

Most LJC Solutions, Projects and output files are prefixed with "LJC" to distinguish them from other potentially similar named items and help prevent naming conflicts.
